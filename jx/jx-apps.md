# Managing Third-Party Applications

> Your cluster will contain many other third-party applications and platforms that you'll have to manage somehow. Following the GitOps principles, you will store the definitions of those additional applications in Git. You will make sure that Git triggers webhooks to the cluster so that pipelines can converge the actual into the desired state. To accomplish that, you'll likely store the information in the declarative format, preferably YAML.
