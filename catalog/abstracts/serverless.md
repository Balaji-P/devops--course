# Demystifying Serverless Computing

Serverless computing is the future. Or, maybe, it's just the hype. It's hard to tell right now, mostly because we do not yet know what serverless is. For some, it is about developing functions (nano services?). For others, it is about not worrying about infrastructure. Some claim that serverless is all about reducing cost, while some say that it is about scalability.

Serverless computing is an execution model where a provider or a platform is responsible for executing code by dynamically allocating resources. We give code (or binaries) to someone, and that someone (or something) ensures that it is running, is highly available, is responsive, and so on.

Let's explore some of the most commonly used serverless implementations and see whether we can clarify what is what, which should be used when, and which might be the best candidate for your use cases.

We'll explore Functions as a Service (FaaS) and Containers as a Service (CaaS), as well as managed and self-managed flavors of serverless computing. We'll see the differences between some of the most commonly used solutions like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, Knative, AWS ECS with Fargate, Azure Container Instances, and Google Cloud Run. Who knows? We might discover that serverless is not what we thought it is.
