# DevOps Do's And Don'ts: Avoiding DevOps Disasters

## Abstract

DevOps is all the hype for a while now. It seems like every company is either in the process of adopting it or it already earned the "DevOps compliant" sticker. Yet, not much has truly changed with DevOps adoption in practice. Why is that? Is DevOps just another hype-without-tangible-benefit invention, or companies failed to implement it correctly? Or, maybe, there are other reasons altogether.

We'll evaluate the state of DevOps as implemented in both smaller startups and some of the biggest enterprises. We'll try to extract lessons learned not only from successes but also from failures. Those experiences will lead us to do's and don'ts of DevOps and will hopefully help us avoid yet another failed attempt to improve our processes and tools.
