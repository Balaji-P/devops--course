> Logging is often misunderstood or, to be more precise, mixed with metrics. For many, the line between logs and metrics is blurred. Some are extracting metrics from logs. Others are treating metrics and logs as the same source of information. Both approaches are wrong. Metrics and logs are separate entities, they serve different purposes, and there is a clear distinction between them.
