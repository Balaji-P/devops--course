# Stop Faking DevOps!

Does your company have a DevOps team? I'm sure you'll say it does because everyone jumped on that train. I'm going to tell you that you are (probably) faking it. You don't know what DevOps is. Even if you do, you probably converted it into a monstrosity because that was an easy way to prove to your director that you are "DevOps certified".

We'll discuss what DevOps really is and what you're doing wrong. Prepare for a fight! All DevOps engineers are welcome.
