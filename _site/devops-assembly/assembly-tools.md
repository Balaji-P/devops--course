Note:
We tend to use a lot of tools, and they differ from one role to another.

Note:
Analysts might use Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Markdown.

Note:
Developers spend most of their time writing code in Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, or Eclipse (only to name a few).

Note:
Testers tend to look at stats in SonarQube, and they might write some automated tests with, let's say, Selenium.

Note:
Operators love VMWare, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenStack, and other tools that help them do their work

Note:
And those in charge of maintenance also have their favorites.

> Software assembly line is all about automation, and not the creative work

Note:
Using tools is not a problem by itself. The real issue is that we are mixing the tools and using them in inappropriate places. We can split them into those that require creative work (e.g., coding, writing stories, and so on) and those that do the repetitive steps. The former should be used while designing the solution, while the latter should be part of the assembly line. It is essential to understand that the **assembly line is all about automation, and not the creative work**. We cannot expect to have an assembly line in which we can say "stop the process, I need to write a test" or "pause everything, I need to get an understanding of that weird result in SonarQube".
