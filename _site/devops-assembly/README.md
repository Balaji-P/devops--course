# Managing and Maintaining a DevOps Assembly Line

Today, most organizations use many tools to develop and deploy software. However this often leads to a fragmented environment where different groups manually kick off scripts to trigger activities in each stage of the development lifecycle. Itâ€™s important to create an assembly line for software creation much like Ford did with the automobile industry, reducing the time it took to assemble a car from 12 hours to 90 minutes.

The software industry however, differs because each team of developers need their own tools to create specialized solutions. How can you manage an assembly line for tens to hundreds of different teams, while enabling them all to ship software, continuously?
