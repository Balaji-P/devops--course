<p><strong>Viktor Farcic</strong> is a Senior Consultant at <strong><a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/">CloudBees</a></strong>, a member of the <strong><a href="https://www.docker.com/community/docker-captains">Docker Captains</a></strong> group, and books author.</p>

<p>He coded using a plethora of languages starting with Pascal (yes, he is old), Basic (before it got Visual prefix), ASP (before it got .Net suffix), C, C++, Perl, Python, ASP.Net, Visual Basic, C#, JavaScript, Java, Scala, etc. He never worked with Fortran. His current favorite is <strong>Go</strong>.</p>

<p>His big passions are DevOps, Microservices, Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment (CI/CD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).</p>

<p>He often speaks at community gatherings and conferences (latest can be found <a href="http://technologyconversations.com/2014/08/06/history/">here</a>).</p>

<p>He published <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-2-0-Toolkit-Containerized-Microservices-ebook/dp/B01BJ4V66M">The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542468914">The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Docker Swarm: Building, testing, deploying, and monitoring services inside Docker Swarm clusters</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Java-Development-Viktor-Farcic-ebook/dp/B00YSIM3SC">Test-Driven Java Development</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-your-book-about-and-why-should-our-readers-read-it">What is your book about, and why should our readers read it?</h2>

<p><strong>The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Docker Swarm: Building, testing, deploying, and monitoring services inside Docker Swarm clusters</strong> is an in depth exploration of Docker with focus on Docker Swarm. It goes beyond basic usage of the scheduler by exploring networking, service discovery, API, volumes, and secrets. It evaluates different ways to set up a cluster on-prem, on AWS, and DigitalOcean. Monitoring and centralized logging are first-class citizens.</p>

<p>The book provides hands-on experience.</p>

<h2 id="what-in-your-opinion-is-the-current-most-exciting-technological-advancement-and-why">What, in your opinion, is the current most exciting technological advancement and why?</h2>

<p>Most of the current advancements are related to schedulers (Docker Swarm and Kubernetes). They work hand in hand with microservices and continuous deployment. I think that 2017 was dedicated mostly to those subjects.</p>

<p>In 2018 we’ll see the emergence of unikernels which might even replace containers. More widely adopted standards for serverless infrastructure will start to emerge allowing us to move away from vendor locking strategies. Machine learning and voice enabled automation will enter the mainstream.</p>

<h2 id="what-inspired-you-to-write-your-books">What inspired you to write your book/s?</h2>

<p>I believe in open source community and like sharing knowledge. Most of my time is spent on message boards, giving talks and workshops, and writing blogs. Books are an extension of those activities. They serve multiple purposes. First of all, writing books is my way of exploring interesting subjects in more depth. They force me to go into details I might not be inclined to go to otherwise.</p>

<p>My books are the result of a community effort. When I get an idea, I start exploring it and writing down the results. I do not have a scope defined in advance. Instead, I publish a book on <a href="https://leanpub.com/">LeanPub.com</a> as soon as only a few chapters are done. From there on, people start reading it and sending me their feedback. They tell me what they like and what should be changed. They notify me about the issues they’re encountering. Most importantly, readers are defining the direction. They tell me what they would like to read in the next chapter, what are the problems they’re facing and what are the issues they’d like to solve. Their feedback is what defines the scope of my books. My name is on the covers, but the books belong to the community around it.</p>

<h2 id="if-theres-one-chapter-in-your-book-people-should-have-read-which-one-should-it-be-and-why">If there’s one chapter in your book people should have read, which one should it be, and why?</h2>

<p>That’s impossible to answer. Every book is a story with a beginning, middle, and the end. It would be like watching only a clip of a movie. It might get you energized to see the whole thing but, more often than not, it reveals parts of the story that should be seen entirely. Start from the beginning, continue if you like it.</p>

<h2 id="as-an-author-which-book-made-the-most-impact-on-you">As an author, which book made the most impact on you?</h2>

<p>There are many. I like to read those written by Dan North and Gojko Adzic when I want something “light”. They are a good read in a bus or a plane. When I’m at home, I prefer more hands-on books. <em>The Way To Go: A Thorough Introduction To The Go Programming Language</em> was an excellent one. However, if I’d have to choose one that made the most impact on me, that would be <em>Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems</em>. The ways they organized their infrastructure tasks is truly stunning and was a great inspiration for some of my works.</p>

<h2 id="if-theres-one-subject-youd-like-to-see-a-book-about-what-would-it-be">If there’s one subject you’d like to see a book about, what would it be?</h2>

<p>I’d like to get my hands on a book about <em>ChatOps</em>. It is a subject that intrigues me lately and, as far as I know, no one wrote an in-depth exploration of the subject. I might my get my hands dirty and use that as inspiration for my next book if no one else beats me to it.</p>

<h2 id="what-would-you-like-to-ask-the-next-author-being-interviewed">What would you like to ask the next author being interviewed?</h2>

<p>Are the good things that come to people who wait, the leftovers of people who went before them?</p>

<h2 id="bonus-question-from-thomas-mailund-is-deckard-a-replicant">Bonus Question from Thomas Mailund: Is Deckard a replicant?</h2>

<p>Yes, he is.</p>

<p>Harrison Ford (claimed that he is no replicant) said to Ridley Scott: <em>“OK, mate. You win! Anything! Just put it to rest.”</em></p>
