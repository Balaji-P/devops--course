# Building Self-Healing Systems

## Keywords

Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment, CD, Docker, DevOps, Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, Consul, Consul Template, Registrator, Jenkins

## Talk Abstract

We can think of the whole computer systems like a human body that consist of cells of various types. Those cells can be hardware or software units. When they are software units, the smaller they are, the easier it is for them to self-heal, recuperate from failures, multiply, or even get destroyed when that is needed. We call those small units microservices, and they can indeed have behaviors similar to those observed in a human body.  Microservices-based systems can be made in a way that they have the ability to self-heal.

We'll explore practices and tools required to set up fully autonomous self-healing systems based on Docker clusters. Such systems will be capable of both reactive recuperation from failures and proactive predictions of steps that should be taken to prevent failures from happening.

## Workshop Abstract

We can think of the whole computer systems like a human body that consist of cells of various types. They can be hardware or software. When they are software units, the smaller they are, the easier it is for them to self-heal, recuperate from failures, multiply or even get destroyed when that is needed. We call those small units microservices, and they can indeed have behaviours similar to those observed in a human body.  The microservices-based system we are building can be made in a way that is has the ability to self-heal. That is not to say that self-healing we are about to explore is applicable only to microservices. It is not. However, self-healing can be applied to almost any type of the architecture but provides best results when combined with microservices.

We'll explore practices and tools required to set up fully autonomous self-healing systems capable of both reactive recuperation from failures and proactive predictions of steps that should be taken to prevent failures before they happen.

We'll use tools like Docker, Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, Consul, Consul Template, Registrator and Jenkins to design and develop a system that is continuously deploying services packed as containers and performs actions that will recuperate it from failures and scale or de-scale depending on historical records.

## Learning Outcomes

## Bio

**Viktor Farcic** is a Senior Consultant at **CloudBees**.

He coded using a plethora of languages starting with Pascal (yes, he is old), Basic (before it got Visual prefix), ASP (before it got .Net suffix), C, C++, Perl, Python, ASP.Net, Visual Basic, C#, JavaScript, Java, Scala, etc. He never worked with Fortran. His current favorite is **Go**.

His big passions are **Microservices**, **Continuous Integration**, **Delivery and Deployment (CI/CD)** and **Test-Driven Development**.

He often speaks at community gatherings and conferences.

He wrote [The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M) and [Test-Driven Java Development](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Java-Development-Viktor-Farcic-ebook/dp/B00YSIM3SC) books.
