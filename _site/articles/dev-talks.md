Q: You are now a Senior Consultant at CloudBees. From your experience, what is the biggest challenge when it comes to consulting services related to DevOps?

A: Corporate culture is always the biggest challenge. Companies think that adopting a new tool will solve problems. However, new tools are created to serve not only today's challenges, but also new processes, and they heavily depend on culture. For example, I often get a request to help companies implement continuous deployment which cannot work successfully if people working on a single product are split into multiple teams and departments. Departments and handovers to different teams is a big impediment towards doing things continuously. Tools alone cannot solve that, and big enterprise companies have a hard time understanding that.

Q: You are the author of the DevOps Toolkit series. What inspired you and what was your main motivation to write them?

A: I love sharing. I spend a lot of time writing blog posts, giving talks on conferences, doing workshops, and in different Slack channels and forums. While all those are good ways to pass a message and share the experience, they are, at the same time, very limiting. There's a limit to how much I can explain in a single blog post, or a 45-minute talk, or even a whole day workshop. Books allow me to truly explore subjects I'm passionate about. They let me express myself on a much deeper and more detailed level.

I started writing the first book only as a way to explore books as yet another medium. Later on, I discovered LeanPub, and that gave me the opportunity to apply agile principles to publishing. Since then, I self-publish all my books. As soon as I write the first chapter, I publish it on LeanPub, and people start reading it. From there on, the rest of the book is a joined effort between me and the readers. They send me feedback, tell me what they like and what they dislike, and they tell me what to write in the next chapter. It's a community effort. I love it.

Q: Where do you see the future of the industry, from your perspective?

A: The future lies in a combination of services and highly skilled work. Almost everyone will move their servers to cloud providers like AWS, GCE, and Azure. As a result, they will adopt their services for most of the easy tasks (and some complicated as well). Software engineers will be left with domain-specific and complex work. The days of doing simple and repetitive tasks are numbered. So, my advice is to become truly proficient in something. You need to be better than others if you hope to keep your job in the future.
