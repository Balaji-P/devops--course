# Why Decision Makers Need To Adopt DevOps?

My job is developer advocacy aimed at communities as well as decision makers (C-level executives). As such, I often hear a question like "why should we adopt DevOps?" There is a short and a long answer to that. The short version is that you have to adopt DevOps because you have to stay alive. Your competition is adopting, or it already adopted DevOps. That means that your competition is being better, faster, and more reliable. Gone are the days when we could work on a project for months (or even years) before releasing it to production. As a matter of fact, even two weeks cycles are too long now. What we expect today is to deliver new features to production on a weekly, daily, or even hourly basis. And why do we want that? Because that's how we manage to adapt to change. That how we continuously deliver value to our customers. More importantly, that's how your competition is operating. There should be no need to convince you that being better, faster, and more reliable is beneficial. No one will reject that. That's the nature of the business. The question that does require an answer is how to do that, and the short answer is in DevOps.

In which phases of software development lifecycle do you think we spend most of the time? The answer is in none. The main problem is not the phases, but the time in between them. Developers wait for business analysts to give them the requirements. Testers wait for developers to finish their code, and developers wait for testers to tell them whether what they did works, or it doesn't. Both developers and testers are waiting for sysadmins to deploy new releases to different environments. And sysadmins are waiting for everyone else to tell them why deployments failed. We spend a tremendous amount of time waiting for something to happen. That's normal since many of us are only cogs in a machine that breaks all the time. We are not masters of our destiny. Heck, we are not even responsible for anything. Who is in charge of a product? The answer is usually "no one in particular". Everyone is in charge of something, but no one is in charge of a product from the beginning to the end. And, to make things even more complicated, no one really cares about anything but their own tiny piece of the work. Does a developer care how his work affects testing and deployment? He doesn't, because that's not his responsibility, and he probably does not even know how is his application tested or deployed. That's someone else's job. Similar can be said for all other departments and expertise. Sysadmins do not care how much time others spend continuously opening JIRA tickets so that something can be deployed. Why would they? Their concern is that their job is optimized, not the whole process. No one cares about the the entire lifecycle of an application, because the responsibility is split among too many silos. As such, there is no empathy. We are communicating with others so poorly that we do not understand how our actions affect them.

DevOps tries to solve those, and many other problems, by building empathy between all those involved in the lifecycle of an application. It does that by joining them into a single team, that responds to a single product owner. It dismantles the silos by creating self-sufficient teams fully in charge of everything related to their application. From start to finish. Such teams are in charge of requirements, development, testing, deployment to production, and even monitoring and pager duty. They are in full control of what's happening with their application. As a result, there is nothing to be handled to other teams (silos). There is no need for inefficient hand-overs in the form of JIRA tickets, emails, and other administrative hurdles created mostly as a solution to the problem of poor communication. When everyone works as a single team focused on a single product (application), communication improves, the need for administrative overhead decreases, the ownership is established, and we create empathy by working together and understanding how our actions affect others. As a result, productivity and quality increases, and costs and time to market decreases. It's the only thing that makes sense. Working as a team is always better than working in isolation. We forgot that by thinking that our work is similar to a factory assembly line. It's not or, to be more precise, it shouldn't be. We're highly skilled professionals tasked to solve problems that are too complex for any individual, so we must work as a team. 

DevOps is all about cultural changes aimed at making autonomous and self-sufficient teams in charge of whole lifecycle of one or more applications. As such, creation of DevOps departments and employment of DevOps engineers is a complete misunderstanding of what DevOps tries to accomplish. DevOps is not about creating more silos, nor it is about renaming existing departments into DevOps. It's about people working together to achieve a common goal (successful release of new features to production). The goals established by silos is not success of a product nor even well being of a company. It's about power. Silos allow people in charge of them to improve their positions and climb the company ladder. That's why they are so hard to dismantle. 

Engineers want to find better ways to work. They want to improve, and they want to work with others. C-level executives want to improve their organization. Their goals are fulfilled if the company is more successful. But, when improvement means removal of silos, the obstacle is in the middle. Mid-range executive, those in charge of those silos, feel that their dismantlement is the threat to their career. "Will I lose my position?" "Will that change take me a step closer or a step further from being a C-level executive?" "Will I lose a bit of power if I lose people below me?" The problem is that C-level executives get their information about the work being done through the managers of those silos. On the other hand, engineers also depend on those managers when they query for company-wide directions created by C-level executives. Being a middleman allows some people to filter messages and make decisions that benefit their personal goals, rather than what's beneficial for the company. They are most threatened by the changes, with DevOps being only the latest manifestation.
