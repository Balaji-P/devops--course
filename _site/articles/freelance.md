I write to inform you that I have decided to quit my job at CloudBees. I have to reduce the number of things I dedicate my time to and will put all my effort into *The DevOps Toolkit* (books, projects and the community around them)

This decision is in no way related to CloudBees. I really like the company and the people I work with and I'm very grateful for having had the chance to collaborate with you. The reason is that the projects I have started on my own are too dear to me to drop and I'm simply not able to continue working so many hours alongside a family life. I don't spend enough time with my family even when I'm at home since I spend almost every moment working on something.

I don't have a fixed last day so I'll let you choose when it would be most appropriate to leave. However, I wanted to let you know before going to Vegas so that the company won't have to waste money on my trip now that I'm leaving.
