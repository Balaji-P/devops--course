  <li>What is your one tip for companies wanting to implement your product/service/solution at a large scale?</li>
</ol>

<p>Elasticity and scalability are the keys. If your product is aimed at large scale, it needs to be able to adapt itself to the ever-changing needs of your users. It has to be able to scale and de-scale depending on the traffic and prediction of the future, and that needs to be fully automated. Gone are the days when we can plan the system needs in advance. With the reaction speed that is expected from us, we cannot, anymore, decide how many servers the system will need since those predictions change from one day to another. If we allocate more servers than needed, we are losing money by having the idle hardware. If the allocation is below the current needs, we are losing customers. The system itself needs to be able to grow, and shrink, depending on the present and future needs, and that change must be automated. I think that we are starting to see systems as autonomous bodies with some kind of a (simple) intelligence capable of making its own decisions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What are the technologies that could influence the development of your product/service/solution in the foreseeable future? And what are the fields that could be influenced by your company?</li>
</ol>

<p>Jenkins has a very complicated goal. It acts as an orchestrator of everything from a commit to a CMS all the way until the application is deployed to production. The number of tools that can be used to perform all the steps in the deployment pipeline is enormous, and we need to support (almost) all of them. Due to such a broad scope, we are bound to follow all the tendencies. As soon as a new tool is released and it seems to get a traction, it is followed by a plugin. In other words, the technologies that influence the development of our product are (almost) all.</p>

<p>Jenkins is probably the main influence in continuous integration (CI), delivery and deployment (CD) area. It, in a way, defined what CI/CD is. Judging by the trends and our resolve, we will continue leading the continuous deployment movement and, through it, be in the front seat of the DevOps movement.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How much does your customers’/clients’/consumers’ feedback matter in how your product/service/solution turns out?</li>
</ol>

<p>User’s feedback is the key to our immediate and future plans. Since our company is based on the open source project, we are used to defining the roadmap based on the needs of our users. Every feature added to the product is a result of someone’s request for that feature. That is the advantage of OSS. While closed source projects tend to guess what users need, with OSS users are developers and developers are users. For that reason, enterprise products based on OSS have a distinct advantage when compared with closed source products. However, that poses quite a challenge. Being behind a successful OSS product, and an enterprise solution that accompanies it, means that the number of users is huge and, with it, the amount of different, and often conflicting, needs and requests we’re receiving is considerably bigger than if the product would be closed source. Listening to your users is nothing new. However, what poses a genuine challenge is the attempt to accommodate those requests fast. It is not uncommon that the time since the request for a fix or a new feature is made until the solution is available is measured in hours for a quick-fix and days, or weeks, until the feature is fully developed, tested, and available to everyone.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In your opinion, how will the world look like in 2030?</li>
</ol>

<p>I think it is impossible to imagine even how will the world look like in 2030. Technology is moving so fast that I would not even be able to predict how would the world look like in 2020. I can only provide my answer limited to a much nearer future and based on the current trends.</p>

<p>I will, however, provide one prediction, before moving towards more evident, short term guesses. Intelligent, self-healing systems will become more and more common. We are, slowly, realizing that the response times required of us are too short and that only machines will be able to perform system adjustments we need. Instead of monitoring the system ourselves and reacting to changed conditions, we’ll expect the system to heal and improve itself. Our jobs, from the operations perspective, will be only to observe the results and improve the “intelligence”.</p>

<p>Now back to short term predictions.</p>

<p>I think that in this year and those that follow we’ll see massive changes in how we architect and deliver software. The focus in the last decade has been in agile methodologies. While they brought a lot of value and drastically changed the way we develop software, they were, mostly, limited in their scope. They are oriented either towards management (e.g. Scrum) or practices that affect developers and testers (e.g. eXtreme Programming). With few exceptions, architecture and operations were left out and, until recently, continued existing in the similar form they did before. With the increase in popularity of DevOps, we’ll see operations and architecture being added to the mix. As a result, we’ll, finally, see continuous deployment becoming the norm. We will be expected to deploy safely new releases to production many times a day. Besides the cultural change that is under way through DevOps, the movement towards continuous deployment will be followed by many technological changes. Breaking the monoliths into microservices will continue gaining momentum and become a standard practice soon. Since microservices are too hard to accomplish without immutability and self-sufficiency, Docker will keep gaining ground. However, we will see new players in that field in the near future. It is still early to say who will be those players, but I am confident that they will emerge.</p>

<p>I think that this and the following year will be dedicated to microservices, containers, continuous deployment, and scalable and elastic systems capable of self-healing. You might say that already happened, but I think that we only scratched the surface.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting areas to look for in the near future are orchestrators. I am intentionally avoiding more precise term since they can have many forms (cluster orchestrators, deployment orchestrators, self-healing orchestrators, and so on). Deployments will be fully automated and our cluster and services running in it will have the ability to self-heal. For that to truly happen, we’ll see a rise in “intelligent” systems that are capable of managing the whole systems lifecycle without human intervention. The tools we have at our disposal right now are not nearly good enough. They only showed us the future and opened the door for machine learning and, later on, artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The future will be all about speed and autonomy. We will define features faster; we’ll develop and test them faster; we’ll deploy them faster. The key is in speed and time-to-market. The systems we develop will be fully autonomous and capable of making complicated decisions without human intervention.</p>
