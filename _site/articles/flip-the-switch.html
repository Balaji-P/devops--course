<p>The chances are that the first time you flip the continuous delivery switch, it will be a failure. You might have thought that it is about designing an automated CD pipeline but the reality is that it requires changes on many different levels.</p>

<p>Your whole organization needs to <strong>be agile</strong>. Otherwise, silos and handovers will prevent you from being continuous.</p>

<p>You will probably have to <strong>refactor your applications</strong>. They need to be designed to be testable, or it will be too expensive to write tests, and they will be too slow to run.</p>

<p>You will have to <strong>educate everyone</strong>. CD is not something done by a separate department but a way of developing applications.</p>

<p>Form <strong>small self-sufficient teams (4 to 10 people)</strong>. Microservices are a good fit. Big applications and big teams are too slow.</p>

<p><strong>Tests will need to be written before a commit</strong>. Otherwise, CD pipeline will not test new features and report everything as green. Adopt TDD.</p>

<p><strong>CD pipeline needs to be fast</strong>. Otherwise, a developer will start working on a new feature before receiving a notification of a failure. Context switching is very time demanding.</p>
