### Day 4

Talk with Huawei Devops trial teams, two teams, half day each.

### Day 5

Anything you particularly want to bring up, a topic propose by you.

## Presentation

### Process

* What is the industry-wide development process for DevOps? Please divide into sub-microservices and single-mode development.

### Team

* What is generally appropriate way to divide partition of Dev and Ops?
* How to efectivelly establish DevOps culture in the team?
* In the team, Huawei would like to set up a role similar to SRE of Google. What's the responsabilities, capacity requirements, and the critical activities undertaken by this role.

### Practice

* For infrastructure and allocation management, how effectivelly to archive idempotent? Please divide into container and non-container modes.
* For microservice development, what's the architectural design related consideration (such as consistency)? How to release quickly with good quality? Is there a clear specification or metrics for microservice? If each microservice has a continuous delivery pipeline, will it lead to heavy maintenance or not?
* What's the special attention to DevOps in clouds? Reliability, resource efficiency, how to satisfy customer experience? How Facebook archives Darklaunch?
* What are the general items in automatic monitoring? Whether monitor will affect the performance and how to avoid?
* Is there intelligent operation and maintenance experience of operating experience? What's the implementation plan?

### Tool

* What is the recommendation for DevOps tools? What are its particular advantages?

### Other

* Current situation and trends for DevOps, latest news and hotspots, as well as related programs and practice
* The analysis for the best and most typical case of DevOps
