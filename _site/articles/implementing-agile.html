<p><strong>Q:</strong> How important is planning to a successful Agile program?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I’m not sure whether planning refers to “Agile transformation” or “Agile iteration”. I’ll assume it’s former.</p>

<p>It is pointless to try implementing Agile only in development teams. Everyone, from CTO down, needs to adopt the new culture. The whole organization needs to change, and that does not happen by accident. Planning is a must. However, we have the chicken and egg type of the problem. Bigger organizations cannot become Agile without planning and planning cannot be done without being Agile. Otherwise, we might fall into the trap of creating Waterfall type of a plan to implement Agile transformation. Such a course of action is bound to fail.</p>

<p>Agile adoption needs to be gradual (not a big-bang transformation) and yet organized and planned using the same principles as those we’re trying to adopt. More often than not, companies do not have that capacity. My advice is to hire an external consultant that already passed that route. The important thing in such a case is that consultant has to have the permission to make decisions without being bound by the existing processes. Otherwise, he’ll hit the old walls we’re trying to dismantle.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> On what criteria should Agile team members be selected?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> In most cases, companies do not start from scratch with liberty to hire everyone anew. It’s not as if we’ll say “let’s shut down this business and create a new one with new people.” So, the only potential selection is within the organization. Agile transformation must be binary. Either the whole company is transformed, or it isn’t. Therefore, those “selected” ones can be considered pioneers that will soon be joined by the rest of the company.</p>

<p>There’s not much reason to use any criteria to select those first Agile members. They are already there. By now, there must be quite a few people in your company who are trying to be Agile and, likely, failing due to company constraints. All you have to do is to let them be. Do not select Agile team members. Remove the obstacles that prevented those with the initiative to succeed.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> How important is communication to a successful Agile initiative?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Communication is one of the key aspects of Agile.</p>

<p>Members of each of your teams are already communicating well. Don’t think they’re not or that they need more of it. They have lunch together, and they go to coffee breaks, many even socialize outside working hours. Much of that time together it spent discussing projects, obstacles, successful stories, and so on. The problem is that your teams might be highly specialized. There might be a QA team, a backend development team, infrastructure team, and many others. The issue is that they speak about things that matter to them and none has a complete overview of a project. They are isolated and have a very narrow view. The key to a better communication is not to set up mandatory stand-up meetings but in the reorganization of the teams. Mix them all. Form cross-functional teams that have all the skills a project needs, from requirements to production. Once you form those teams, communication will take a different turn. It’s not that there will be more of it, but it will be more diversified and, thus, increase the overall knowledge and skill sets. Remove departments and conflicting chains of command. There is an application or a service, and a team working on it. When that team reports to the same person, has autonomy, and posses all the skills it needs, communication happens by itself.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What should be taken into consideration when setting a project’s scope?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> What can be delivered to production in a relatively short period? New features running in production is the only true definition of done. Everything else is Waterfall in disguise. With such a clear definition, a cross-functional team should be able to define a scope. They know better than anyone what can be done in, let’s say, two weeks.</p>

<p>Your teams will fail to estimate the first few sprints. They will be overconfident and end up delivering only half of the scope, or they will be too pessimistic in their estimates and deliver much more. All they require is time. Each sprint will be closer to the estimated scope. It’s all about practice and consistency. That’s why members of a cross-functional team should be, more or less, permanent.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> How important is testing to project success?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> It is indispensable. No one disputes that anymore. The market is so saturated that a single bad experience is enough for a user to go for a different solution. What is still, unfortunately, not clear is that most of the testing needs to be automated. I still see far too often companies that rely, for the bulk of their testing, on manual tasks. It is still common for a company to have an army of testers who do not know how to code and are, hence, incapable to automate their work. The discussion of the importance of testing is over. However, we are yet to see (almost) full automation of those repetitive tasks that do not bring real value to the company. People should be engaged with creative and challenging tasks, not to repeat the same set of manual tests over and over again.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What’s the best way to win support from management and staff?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> We are looking at a very polarized industry right now. Part of it consists of “new breed” of managers with very strong technical skills. They never stopped coding and understand better than anyone the necessity to keep the tools and processes up to date. Unfortunately, there is still a bulk of managers that are locked in the past. Some of them were never technical while others stopped following up when they moved from technical to management positions. It’s been over fifteen years since Agile manifesto was born. I’m afraid that those that are not yet convinced of the need to be Agile are lost and can not be brought back to reality. We must hope they will retire soon because that might be the only solution.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the role of customer feedback in successful Agile project?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Customer feedback is one of the main reasons behind the idea of short iterations. We deliver something after a couple of weeks, get feedback from our users, and adapt our plans. Gone are the days when we could have a project that delivers results to user’s hands after a year. Competition is ruthless, and users do not give second chances. It’s impossible to predict what they will want a year from now. Instead, we measure their pulse by delivering often and capturing feedback that gets transformed into plans for next iterations. It is the only way to stay ahead of the curve and deliver what users want, not what we think they might need some time in the future.</p>
