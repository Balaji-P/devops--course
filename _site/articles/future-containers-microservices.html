<h2 id="where-are-you-or-your-customers-when-it-comes-to-container-and-microservices-adoption">Where are you (or your customers) when it comes to container and microservices adoption?</h2>

<p>Containers are crucial part of our products. We believe that the future of all software distribution is in containers and that schedulers (e.g., Kubernetes, Swarm, Mesos) are a huge leap in how software should be deployed to clusters. We are probably one of the first enterprise software companies that based the strategy fully on containers and schedulers.</p>

<p>In the beginning, when we released CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise (CJE) that is a full cluster solution running on Mesos, reaction from enterprise customers was mixed. Everyone understood the tremendous value behind fault-tolerance, high-availability, and optimum usage of resources. However, back than, the world was not yet ready to fully embrace containers. This year (2017) was a turning point. Enterprise companies started being ready for containers. Some of the adopted them while many are in the process of switching to them. I think that the next year (2018) will be the year when most will adopt containers and Kubernetes as the most prominent scheduling solution.</p>

<p>I’m very content that most of our customers were introduced to Docker and schedulers through CJE and that they are now extending container usage beyond CI/CD pipelines.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-see-container-and-microservices-adoption-changing-in-large-enterprises-in-the-year-ahead">How do you see container and microservices adoption changing in large enterprises in the year ahead?</h2>

<p>This year was the year when many enterprises experimented with containers. The next year will be the year of widespread adoption. We will, finally, be able to say that Docker and Kubernetes are de-facto standards to package and deploy applications. All those experiments will finally reach production clusters.</p>

<p>Microservices, on the other hand, are in use with large enterprises for a while longer than containers. However, when packaged and deployed using traditional methods, microservices are too costly and complicated. We’ll need to wait until containers are fully adopted before the value behind microservices becomes big enough for enterprises to adopt them fully.</p>

<h2 id="what-impact-will-containers-and-microservices-have-on-it-efforts-to-automate-processes-what-are-some-of-the-biggest-barriers-to-container-and-microservices-adoption-today">What impact will containers and microservices have on IT efforts to automate processes? What are some of the biggest barriers to container and microservices adoption today?</h2>

<p>The biggest barrier to adoption of microservices and containers are silos. Big enterprises did not yet adopt the idea of multi-functional teams. On the other hand, both containers and microservices are based on the idea that a self-sufficient teams that take full control of software development life-cycle. Both are coming with a strong emphasis on DevOps which, in its essence, is introducing cultural change. In enterprises, it is more difficult to change culture than tools. Yet, both go hand in hand and failure to change one leads to failure in adoption of the other.</p>

<h2 id="how-will-they-be-overcome">How will they be overcome?</h2>

<p>The problems will be overcome through failures. Even though failure is perceived as a negative thing, it is very positive since it leads to new experience. Companies are (or will) be failing to introduce microservices without containers, and both will fail without cultural changes. Those cultural shifts are today leaning towards DevOps. Those failures will make decision makers question current technology and practices and lead to improvements. I am optimistic that 2018 will be the year when containers, microservices, and DevOps will become widely spread.</p>
