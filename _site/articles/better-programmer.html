      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you give me your background? What are you doing at Cloudbees and what were you doing previously? Are you a programmer?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I work in CloudBees professional services group. We help companies adopt continuous delivery and DevOps practices. However, my “official” position is only a small part of what I do. I speak a lot at conferences, maintain quite a few open source projects, write books, do workshops, experiment with new tech, and so on. I like helping others, so almost everything I do is somehow focused towards that goal. You can say that I’m a programmer that decided to stop being an introvert.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why did you get into this industry?</p>

<p>I’ve been in this industry for around 25 years. I’m not even sure why and how I ended up in IT. I was impressed with computers since I was eight and most of the things I did involve them one way or another, from writing the first accounting system for my high school, through working in many small and big companies, all the way to teaching programming at a university.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> When you see posts that say “how to become a better programmer” what do you think? What tips come to mind?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Learn how to program. That sounds obvious, doesn’t it? I think that many make a mistake thinking that a good programmer is a person who mastered all the details of a programming language of choice. I, on the other hand, believe that a good programmer is a person who can program in multiple languages, who can understand the differences between functional and object oriented languages, who can start coding in a new language after only an hour or two of introduction. Those and many other qualities cannot be accomplished by focusing on only one language. Mastering the logic used in different programming paradigms allows us to become truly proficient programmers.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are some basic skills you suggest programmers master if they want to be “better” at what they do?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Programmers should learn all the skills. Without understanding the whole software development process, one cannot do his work well. A good programmer must know testing and should apply test-driven development principles. He should understand the infrastructure his service will be deployed to. He should understand monitoring, and alerting frameworks. And so on and so forth. The list is long and is growing with each day. Everything influences everything else, and we can do our jobs well only after we gain at least a basic knowledge of everything. I think that a real professional is a person that understands all aspects of a software development cycle and only then specializes into one of the areas.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you do to stay on top of new technologies and how do you strive to become a better programmer (or whatever you are doing now, how do you strive to be better at that)?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I don’t have a formula for staying on top of new technologies. I’m just making sure that I spend enough time exploring. That can be a new book, a blog post, a conference, or a new open source project. I tend to try everything I see. The biggest problem is how to find enough free time to dedicate to “self-education.” In my case, willingness to allow employees to spend time exploring new technology is a deciding factor on an interview. I would, without a doubt, reject any offer to work for a company that does not see value in giving employees free time to explore. There is no learning without dedication, and there is no dedication without time. If a company you work for does not foster self-improvement, leave now. Such a company will become exterminated, and the skills its employees have will have little or no value on a job market.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What advice would you give “newbie” programmers?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Join an open source project. There is no better way to improve and learn than to work with other people on the same project without being bound by limitations imposed by commercial entities. Start small. Choose a tool or a framework you like (if you’re out of ideas, join <a href="https://github.com/docker-flow/docker-flow-proxy">Docker Flow Proxy</a>) and start with a very simple pull request. Correct or improve documentation. Answer a question. Fix the simplest issue you can find. From there on you’ll enter into conversations with other contributors and start doing more and more complex PRs. The rest will come by itself.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you feel pressured to work all the time? How demanding is your job and how demanding is coding, software, etc?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I am under a lot of pressure. We all are. Our industry is changing so fast that keeping up is very hard. It’s a race, and many are falling behind. Trying to stay in is hard, and it requires a lot of discipline and time. Luckily, I am fortunate not to experience pressures that many others are experiencing. CloudBees is a company that believes in people. There is a lot of trust and, as a result, there is no management pressure. Nobody is breathing down my neck and asking for status every hour or insists on working 29 hours a day. In other words, I receive no pressure from my company but from the industry itself. It’s hard to keep your head above water when winds are constantly changing direction.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> If you could learn one new technology, language, etc. what would you want to learn and why? (Ex: Ruby on Rails, or deep learning)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> This is an easy question. Learn Go. It’s a modern language designed to solve problems industry is facing today. I’m sure its popularity will continue rising. It’s enough to look at new open source projects. Unlike those done by companies that, in many cases, restrict choices, OSS projects (when starting from scratch) have complete freedom to choose a language. When there is freedom to choose, Go is the king.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What does the future look like for programmers in your opinion?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I don’t know the future. Nobody does. Things are changing so fast that any type of a prediction is a wild guess. The only thing I’m certain is that everything will continue accelerating. Change will be more and more frequent. As a result, the time we spend learning will continue increasing as well. We are, and will continue being, lifetime students who spend most of the time learning and do the actual job only part-time. Those who cannot learn fast or are unable to dedicate enough time for education will drop out. My only prediction is that those who try to predict the future will most likely fail.</p>
