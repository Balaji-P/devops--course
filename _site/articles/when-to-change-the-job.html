      <p>The reason to look for a new job should be purely selfish. You should ask yourself a simple question. “If I stay here, will my value on the market increase?”.</p>

<p>It all boils down to company’s ability to follow the trends and to give you demanding tasks that will make you improve your skills and knowledge. If that is not happening, you might end up with twenty years of “repeated” experience. That is not the same as twenty years of “real” experience. Nobody wants to be a principal engineer with skills that are valued as junior in other companies. Unfortunately, that happens a lot. People get fired, and companies go under. Saying “I have many years of experience with DB2” does not land you a good position.</p>

<p>The second reason to leave is related to playing. Most of us become engineers because we like to “play” with new tech. That not only increases knowledge and experience but also makes us happy.</p>

<p>The demand for good engineers is vast. Staying in a company that does not allow you to grow, that does not increase your value on the market, and that does not let you “play”, is not worth staying. Leave immediately!</p>
