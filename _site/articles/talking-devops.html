      <ul>
  <li>Why you wrote this book, what are you trying to answer by interviewing these people, effectively the purpose of this book.</li>
</ul>

<p>I love sharing with others. That’s my main motivation when writing books. There is a hard-to-explain joy in knowledge that our work might be helping others. But, that is not the case with this bok. This time, the motivation is much more egoistic. I wanted to understand what DevOps is. Isn’t that a strange desire coming from someone who works as a consultant, usually on DevOps-related topics and who published quite a few books belonging to “The DevOps Toolkit Series”? Surely I should know what DevOps is if I am to sell my services.</p>

<p>DevOps is not a well defined process. There is no set of rules that must be followed. It is even questionable whether there is such a thing as a “DevOps department” or a “DevOps engineer”. All we have is an idea that people should work more closely together and that we should remove barriers that slow us down. As such, anything can be DevOps. Almost every software company is marketing its products as “DevOps”. “DevOps engineer” is the most sought-for role in job listings. “DevOps departments” are popping up like mushrooms after rain. And yet, almost every person I spoke with gave me a different answer to the question “what is DevOps?”</p>

<p>My main objective with this book is to answer a simple question. “What is DevOps?” So, I asked many practioners. Some of them are the industry veterans, while others are up-and-comming stars. Some are my friends, while others are people I admired from afar.</p>

<p>I love going to conferences, but not for the obvious reasons. I rarely listen to talks. Instead, I tend to roam the corridors looking for the next victim that will allow me to pick his or her brain. The best thing about the conferences is networking. The most interesting conversations are not happening in scheduled talks, but rather in corridors, and after-parties. I consider myself lucky for being able to dedicate an important portion of my time to conferences since I know that I benefit greatly from those “corridor-talks”. So, I wanted to do something similar with this book.</p>

<p>Each conversation starts with the innocent question “what is DevOps?”. It is only meant to be a conversation-starter and to facilitate something that is un unstructured, unpreepared, and very casual conversation. Think of each interview as a conversation with a friend or an acquitance that I met in a pub. As a matter a fact, a few of those were recorded in a bar over a few beers.</p>

<p>All in all, I wanted to share casual conversations with people who practice and often shape DevOps. My hope is that we’ll be able to get an insight into what drives those people and get a better understanding into what makes DevOps so powerful.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The power of DevOps today (Why should people outside the field be interested in the word)</li>
</ul>

<p>DevOps brings sanity into a very chaotic world created through missunderstanding that software develpoment is similar to factory production. It continues where Agile left and urges us to remove the obstacles that we were often not even aware existed. It builds empathy that results in greater cooperation. It is about culture, but also about the processes and the tools. At least, that’s what I thought, even though I got very oposing definitions from the teams I worked with. This book is an attempt to get a broader view from industry leaders and experts that practice DevOps from the trenches.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How you selected the people in this book, along with your relationship to them.</li>
</ul>

<p>The people I interviewed come from very different backgrounds and levels of experience. Some of them defined DevOps and were involved with it from the start. Others tranformed their organizations. There are veterans as well as new blood coming with fresh ideas. Some of them are my friends, while others are people I admired from afar. The only thing they all have in common is DevOps. However, you’ll see that some of them have very oposing views of what DevOps is. You will often feel that what is described by one person contradicts what others said. That is intentional and, in my opinion, reflects the chaos DevOps is trying to tame and that we are still in very early stages of the adoption. We’re all trying to navigate the complexities of the software industry and comming with different solutions to the same problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What form you took with the interviews (Generally, asked them to introduce themselves, define DevOps, predict the future e.t.c)</li>
</ul>

<p>I wanted the interviews to be casual. I did not want people to answer to predefined questions. Instead, my wish is to bring to a wider audience the types of conversations I normally have with experts I meet in conferences and in companies I work with as a consultant. I do believe that some of the best breakthroughs come from corridor-talks. That’s the spirit I wanted to maintain in the interviews. Aside of introductions, the only prepared question I had for each interview is “what is DevOps?” It’s a conversation starter, not a script. I hope that approach allowed people to be relaxed and speak their minds.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What surprised you, what didn’t – What are the biggest factors you took away from the interviews.</li>
</ul>

<p>I knew that there are many oposing views about DevOps. I understand that the implementation varies greatly from one organization to another. However, I was not prepared to learn that the way DevOps is implemented across the industry varies even more than what I thought. Almost every interview has a different spin on DevOps. None of those I spoke with gave me the same answer to the “what is DevOps?” question. The differences are bigger than what I imagined.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When are where the conversations were recorded. (Idea being you spoke to people from around the world)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some conversations are recorded through remote sessions, while others were made in pubs or in a conference corridors. Whenever I could, I did my best to speak with someone eye-to-eye.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Possibly: If you want, link it to your DevOps toolkit series.</li>
</ul>

<p>https://www.devopstoolkitseries.com/</p>

<ul>
  <li>A message to the reader.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be open minded. You almost certainly heard about DevOps and you are likely implementing it right now. Leave what you know aside. The interviews are likely to put what you know upside down. They will challenge your assumptions and your experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A thanks to those you interviewed.</li>
</ul>

<p>I couldn’t be more grateful to all the people that accepted to dedicate time to speak to me. Thank you! You made this book great.</p>
