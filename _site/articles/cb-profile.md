1. Who are you? What is your role at CloudBees?

I work as a consultant. My job is to visit our customers and give them advice how to improve their processes and tools related to DevOps and continuous delivery or deployment.

What I like about this position is that it allows me to experience many different situations and scenarios. Each company is different and having aggregated experience from many gives me a unique knowledge. One thing is to be proficient in a certain language, tool, or a framework. There is a clear value in that. However, being able to compare all the different ways companies are implementing their solutions is priceless.

Consulting is only a part of what I do. I often speak at conferences and hold workshops. I love learning from others and sharing.

2. What makes CloudBees different from other companies?

CloudBees is a distributed company. We are still small and yet we are distributed all around the globe, from Australia, through Europe, all the way until US. Some of us work from an office, while many others work from home. If there is something that distinguishes CloudBees from many other companies is flexibility. We are aware that the best results are accomplished by letting people be creative.
