      <h2 id="does-the-rise-of-devops-undermine-agile">Does the rise of DevOps undermine Agile?</h2>

<p>I think that the question is not well defined. It assumes that DevOps and Agile are two separate things that compete with each other. I see it differently. I think that DevOps is evolution of Agile in the same way as continuous delivery and deployment (CD) evolved from continuous integration (CI). Just as we cannot do CD without first mastering CI, we cannot successfully adopt DevOps culture and tooling without being agile practitioners.</p>

<p>When Agile appeared it tried to solve some of the problems of that era. Among many other things, it proposed creation of small and self-sufficient teams that would be capable of performing the whole process. Those teams did everything from gathering requirements, through coding and testing, all the way until delivering a finished set of features to sys admins who, in turn, made sure that the services those teams delivered were successfully running in production. At that time, self-sufficiency did not involve the whole lifecycle of an application. Agile managed to unite business analysts (renamed to product owners), testers, and developers. That was a huge leap forward when we compare it with the waterfall model. Agile managed to establish a better way to develop software.</p>

<p>Today, our requirements are different than they were before. We are trying to deploy services continuously, not only integrate them. We design systems at scale that was no imaginable ten years ago. We do not tolerate downtime. We expect our clusters to be elastic. And so on and so forth. The needs we have today are quite different than those we had before. Those needs were transformed into the DevOps movement. They did not come out of nowhere. They evolved over time. Our objectives are evolving and, with them, the processes and tools we use to accomplish them.</p>

<p>DevOps evolved from Agile. That evolution absorbed Agile and changed it into something bigger and more efficient in solving the problems we are facing today.</p>

<h2 id="can-agile-really-survive-as-devops-becomes-more-ubiquitous">Can Agile really survive as DevOps becomes more ubiquitous?</h2>

<p>Did continuous integration survive the rise in popularity of continuous delivery? It did, by being an integral part of it. You do continuous delivery by extending continuous integration. The same can be said for DevOps. You do DevOps by extending agility (mainly by including sys admins and operators into the club).</p>

<p>Agile will continue living as part of DevOps. With time, we might stop using Agile as the word, but its principles will continue dominating the DevOps movement. Both foment smaller teams, better communication, better efficiency, faster delivery, and so on. They are both based on the idea that we need to adapt to changes instead following a plan. That adaptation is today called DevOps. The major difference is that, this time, we accomplish our objectives by including sys admins and operators into the mix. That inclusion opened some doors that were previous locked and when we step through them, the world gets extended with new possibilities.</p>

<h2 id="is-there-anything-else-youd-like-to-share-about-this-topic">Is there anything else youâ€™d like to share about this topic?</h2>

<p>Just as Agile evolved into DevOps, DevOps will also continue evolving until, one day, we start calling it something else.</p>

<p>We, the human race, never truly invent anything new. Inventions are only an illusion. Most people see only final the products and think that they are truly new. Most of us do not see all the little steps that took us from one point to another. The truth is that everything we do is an evolution. We change tiny details, see the result, change a bit more, observe the behavior, and so on. We repeat those steps over and over again. Over time, those small changes lead to bigger improvements that we, finally, present as something new. Agile transformation into DevOps is one of the examples.</p>

<p>Even DevOps is nowhere near what it was when it started. At the beginning, the focus was on cultural changes and automation of the processes. More and more things were automated, but not many were truly transformed. For example, DevOps practitioners would create scripts and tools that would move an application throughout its whole lifecycle. Build, test, deploy, test some more, reconfigure, monitor. At that time, we did not try to change applications. We did not try to make them more deployable, easier to test, better at scaling, and so on. We just came up with a lot of tools that allowed us to do the same. The key was in automation that allowed us to do things faster and in a more reliable manner.</p>

<p>With time we started understanding that automation can only get us half way to where we want to be. As a result, we started going back to the roots. We started looking at automation as something that comes at the end. We started re-architecturing our code. We started changing foundations of our applications so that they respond better to the needs for scaling, fault tolerance, responsiveness, and so on. What was initially an attempt to automate everything, got transformed into the movement that wants to completely change everything we do. We started breaking monoliths into microservices, deploying to production many times a day, adopting new languages, packaging infrastructure into immutable images, and many other fundamental changes to the software industry. No process is sacred any more, and no application is made to last forever.</p>

<p>While many are still trying to figure out what DevOps is and how they can benefit from it, others already entering the post-DevOps era which, until a better name comes up, I tend to call DevOps 2.0.</p>
