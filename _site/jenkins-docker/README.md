# The DevOps 2.2 Toolkit: Jenkins

## Abstract: Workshop

The combination of Docker and Jenkins improves your continuous deployment pipeline using fewer resources. It also helps you scale up your builds, automate tasks, provide high availability, and speed up Jenkins performance with the benefits of Docker containerization.

The goal of the training course is to design a fully automated continuous deployment (CDP) pipeline. We’ll see how Microservices fit into CDP and immutable containers concepts and why the best results are obtained when those three are combined into one unique framework. We’ll explore tools like Docker, container schedulers, Docker Compose, Jenkins, and quite a few others. The end result will be a fully operational continuous deployment pipeline that will deploy a new release to production with every commit.

This training course will walk you through setting up a Docker cluster and deploying Jenkins master and agent services. It will then provide steps to run unit tests and build applications as Docker images. Once we understand the process through Docker commands we'll automate it through Jenkins pipeline. Further on, we'll explore how we can extend the pipeline with functional and other types of automated tests that will give us confidence that the application under test passed all the quality requirements. Moving on you will learn how to deploy new releases to production without encountering downtime, and run post-production deployment tests. We'll extend Jenkins pipeline to include all the steps, thus creating a fully functional continuous deployment process.

Moving on, we'll explore how to optimize the continuous deployment pipeline. You'll learn how to use shared libraries for the common code used across different pipelines and how to store those pipelines in a version control repository (e.g., GitHub) and allow teams in charge of applications to take control of their continuous deployment processes while still leveraging commonly used snippets.

**What is this training about, and why is it important?**

This training is aimed at teaching you to improve your processes by creating a fully automated continuous deployment pipeline using Docker, schedulers, and Jenkins. You will be able to explore the lethal combination of Docker and Jenkins in order to enhance the DevOps workflow

**What You’ll learn—and how you can apply it**

* Create a cluster
* Deploy Jenkins master as a service and scale it using Docker-based agents
* Understand the principles and the technical aspects of a successful Continuous Delivery pipeline
* Create a complete Continuous Delivery process using modern tools like Docker and Jenkins
* Build and deploy applications with Jenkins using Docker Swarm cluster
* Publish a built Docker image to a Docker Registry and deploy cycles of Jenkins pipelines using community best practice


**This Live Training is for you because...**

The course is aimed at DevOps Engineers, developers and IT Operations who want to enhance the DevOps culture using Docker and Jenkins. If you have been struggling to find the time to gain proficiency and confidence with Docker containers, Continuous Delivery and everyday DevOps tasks, here is your one stop solution!
