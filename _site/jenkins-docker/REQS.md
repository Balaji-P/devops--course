## Requirements

This workshop contains a vast amount of topics and will be performed at a very fast pace. The recommendation is to observe the commands I will be executing and concentrate on understanding the logic behind them. Everything will be posted online after the workshop and you will be able to repeat it later on at your own pace. If you agree with the recommendation, you will not be required to bring anything.

On the other hand, you are welcome to follow along and try to reproduce everything during the workshop. If you choose that approach, you will need:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
* GitBash (if using Windows, it's installed with Git)
* [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) user

If you are a Windows user, please make sure that your Git client is configured to check out the code *AS-IS*. Otherwise, Windows might change carriage returns to the Windows format. You will also need an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). Please note that it should be free from any customizations and limitations your company might have introduced. If in doubt, please use your personal account.
