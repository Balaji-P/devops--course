# Jenkins @ Scale

Agile changed the way we develop software, but it failed to change the way we deliver it. As a result of facing new challenges, we got DevOps. We got a cross-disciplinary community of practice dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating rapidly changing resilient systems at scale.

How does Jenkins fit into this world? Can we run it at scale? How to accomplish elasticity? These are some of the questions we'll have to answer if Jenkins is to continue being the leader of the CD and DevOps movement.

This presentation attempts to outline the steps you need to take for a fully-automated Jenkins pipeline that continuously builds, tests and deploys microservices into a cluster. Moreover, we'll explore ways to create a scalable and fault tollerant Jenkins with highly dynamic and elastic agents.

**Viktor Farcic** is a Senior Consultant at **[CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com/)**, a member of the **[Docker Captains](https://www.docker.com/community/docker-captains)** group, and books author.

He coded using a plethora of languages starting with Pascal (yes, he is old), Basic (before it got Visual prefix), ASP (before it got .Net suffix), C, C++, Perl, Python, ASP.Net, Visual Basic, C#, JavaScript, Java, Scala, etc. He never worked with Fortran. His current favorite is **Go**.

His big passions are DevOps, Microservices, Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment (CI/CD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

He often speaks at community gatherings and conferences.

He published [The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-2-0-Toolkit-Containerized-Microservices-ebook/dp/B01BJ4V66M), [The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Docker Swarm: Building, testing, deploying, and monitoring services inside Docker Swarm clusters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542468914) and the [Test-Driven Java Development](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Java-Development-Viktor-Farcic-ebook/dp/B00YSIM3SC). He is currently working on his third book [The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Docker Swarm](https://leanpub.com/the-devops-2-1-toolkit)
