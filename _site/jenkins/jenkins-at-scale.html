      <h1 id="jenkins--scale">Jenkins @ Scale</h1>

<p>Agile changed the way we develop software, but it failed to change the way we deliver it. As a result of facing new challenges, we got DevOps. We got a cross-disciplinary community of practice dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating rapidly changing resilient systems at scale.</p>

<p>How does Jenkins fit into this world? Can we run it at scale? How to accomplish elasticity? These are some of the questions we’ll have to answer if Jenkins is to continue being the leader of the CD and DevOps movement.</p>

<p>This presentation attempts to outline the steps you need to take for a fully-automated Jenkins pipeline that continuously builds, tests and deploys microservices into a cluster. Moreover, we’ll explore ways to create a scalable and fault tollerant Jenkins with highly dynamic and elastic agents.</p>
