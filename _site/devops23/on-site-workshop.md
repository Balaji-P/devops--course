# Continuous Deployment To Kubernetes with self healing, adaptation enabled, with enhance monitoring and logging.

## Audience

People that form a self-sufficient team. All expertise is required for a full software development life-cycle. That expertise must include building software, testing, deployment, and monitoring.

## Outcome

Fully operational local cluster with services and processes required for continuous deployment, logging, monitoring, and alerting, self-adaptation and healing.

## Duration

5 days

## Venue

On-site at Telstra in Melbourne

## Group size

5-20 staff

## Format

Each topic is a mixture of theory, hands-on exercises and best practise expert instruction.

## Instructor

Viktor Farcic

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with basic Linux operations.
Internet connection favourably with WIFI.

**Viktor Farcic** is a consultant, a member of the **[Docker Captains](https://www.docker.com/community/docker-captains)** group, and books author.

He coded using a plethora of languages starting with Pascal (yes, he is old), Basic (before it got Visual prefix), ASP (before it got .Net suffix), C, C++, Perl, Python, ASP.Net, Visual Basic, C#, JavaScript, Java, Scala, etc. He never worked with Fortran. His current favorite is **Go**.

His big passions are DevOps, Microservices, Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment (CI/CD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

He often speaks at community gatherings and conferences (latest can be found [here](http://technologyconversations.com/2014/08/06/history/)).

He published [The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-2-0-Toolkit-Containerized-Microservices-ebook/dp/B01BJ4V66M), [The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Docker Swarm: Building, testing, deploying, and monitoring services inside Docker Swarm clusters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542468914), [The DevOps 2.2 Toolkit: Self-Sufficient Docker Clusters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1979347190), and the [Test-Driven Java Development](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Java-Development-Viktor-Farcic-ebook/dp/B00YSIM3SC).
