<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Kubernetes is a container scheduler and quite a lot more. We can use it to deploy our services, to roll out new releases without downtime, and to scale (or de-scale) those services. It is portable. It can run on a public or private cloud. It can run on-premise or in a hybrid environment. Kubernetes, in a way, makes your infrastructure vendor agnostic. We can move a Kubernetes cluster from one hosting vendor to another without changing (almost) any of the deployment and management processes. Kubernetes can be easily extended to serve nearly any needs. We can choose which modules we’ll use, and we can develop additional features ourselves and plug them in.</p>

<p>If we choose to use Kubernetes, we decide to relinquish control. Kubernetes will decide where to run something and how to accomplish the state we specify. Such control allows Kubernetes to place replicas of a service on the most appropriate server, to restart them when needed, to replicate them, and to scale them. We can say that self-healing is a feature included in its design from the start.</p>

<p>Zero-downtime deployments, fault tolerance, high availability, scaling, scheduling, and self-healing should be more than enough to see the value in Kubernetes. Yet, that is only a fraction of what it provides. We can use it to mount volumes for stateful applications. It allows us to store confidential information as secrets. We can use it to validate the health of our services. It can load balance requests and monitor resources. It provides service discovery and easy access to logs. And so on and so forth. The list of what Kubernetes does is long and rapidly increasing. Together with Docker, it is becoming a platform that envelops whole software development and deployment lifecycle.</p>

<p>The goal of this live training course is to learn fundamentals required to operate a Kubernetes cluster and deploy and manage applications life-cycle. You will learn all the essential and commonly used constructs and resources.</p>

</ul>

<p>If you are a Windows user, please make sure that your Git client is configured to check out the code AS-IS. Otherwise, Windows might change carriage returns to the Windows format.</p>

<p>Please double check that VirtualBox, minikube, and kubectl work by executing:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>minikube start —vm <span class="nv">driver</span><span class="o">=</span>virtualbox

kubectl gets nodes

minikube delete
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>

<p>The timeframes are only estimates and may vary according to how the class is progressing</p>

<h2 id="day-1-4-hours">Day 1 (4 hours)</h2>

<h3 id="section-1-building-docker-images">Section 1: Building Docker Images</h3>

<p>Create a Dockerfile with Multi-Stage builds that envelops the whole CI process from running unit tests, through building binaries, all the way until a Docker image is created and pushed to a registry. We’ll build one Docker image based on https://github.com/vfarcic/go-demo-3/blob/master/Dockerfile. Later on, we’ll use mongo, jenkins, golang, and a few other images</p>

<p>### Section 2: What Is A Container Scheduler?</p>

<p>Learn the short history of software and infrastructure development, why we need containers and container schedulers, and what is Kubernetes.</p>

<h3 id="section-3-running-a-kubernetes-cluster-locally">Section 3: Running A Kubernetes Cluster Locally</h3>
<h3 id="section-3-running-a-kubernetes-cluster-in-aws-using-eks">Section 3: Running A Kubernetes Cluster in AWS using EKS</h3>

<p>Minikube creates a single-node cluster inside a VM on your laptop. While that is not ideal since we won’t be able to demonstrate some of the features Kubernetes provides in a multi-node setup, it should be more than enough to explain most of the concepts behind Kubernetes.</p>

<h3 id="section-4-creating-pods">Section 4: Creating Pods</h3>

<p>A Pod encapsulates one or more containers. It provides a unique network IP, it attaches storage resources, and it decides how containers should run. Everything in a Pod is tightly coupled.</p>

<h3 id="section-5-scaling-pods-with-replicasets">Section 5: Scaling Pods With ReplicaSets</h3>

<p>ReplicaSet’s primary, and pretty much only function, is to ensure that a specified number of replicas of a Pod matches the actual state (almost) all the time. That means that ReplicaSets make Pods scalable.</p>

<h2 id="day-2-4-hours">Day 2 (4 hours)</h2>

<h3 id="section-6-using-services-to-enable-communication-between-pods">Section 6: Using Services To Enable Communication Between Pods</h3>

<p>We need a stable, never-to-be-changed address that will forward requests to whichever Pod is currently running. Kubernetes Services provide addresses through which associated Pods can be accessed.</p>

<p>### Section 7: Deploying Releases With Zero-Downtime</p>

<p>While we might never be able to reach 100% availability, we should certainly not cause downtime ourselves and must minimise other factors that could cause downtime. We’ll try to accomplish zero-downtime deployment of new releases through Kubernetes Deployments.</p>

<h3 id="section-8-using-ingress-to-forward-traffic">Section 8: Using Ingress To Forward Traffic</h3>

<p>Ingress objects manage external access to the applications running inside a Kubernetes cluster. It provides an API that allows us to accomplish path and domain routing and SSL certifications, in addition to a few other features we expect from a dynamic cluster.</p>

<h3 id="section-9-using-volumes-to-access-hosts-file-system">Section 9: Using Volumes To Access Host’s File System</h3>

<p>Kubernetes Volumes solve the need to preserve the state across container crashes. In essence, Volumes are references to files and directories made accessible to containers that form a Pod.</p>

<h2 id="day-3-4-hours">Day 3 (4 hours)</h2>

<h3 id="section-10-using-configmaps-to-inject-configuration-files">Section 10: Using ConfigMaps To Inject Configuration Files</h3>

<p>ConfigMaps allow us to keep configurations separate from application images. Such separation is useful when other alternatives are not a good fit.</p>

<h3 id="section-11-using-secrets-to-hide-confidential-information">Section 11: Using Secrets To Hide Confidential Information</h3>

<p>We cannot treat all information equally. Sensitive data needs to be handled with additional care. Kubernetes provides an additional level of protection through Secrets.</p>

<h3 id="section-12-dividing-a-cluster-into-namespaces">Section 12: Dividing A Cluster Into Namespaces</h3>

<p>Applications and corresponding objects often need to be separated from each other to avoid conflicts and other undesired effects.</p>

<h3 id="section-13-securing-kubernetes-clusters">Section 13: Securing Kubernetes Clusters</h3>

<p>Security implementation is a game between a team with a total lock-down strategy and a team that plans to win by providing complete freedom to everyone. You can think of it as a battle between anarchists and totalitarians. The only way the game can be won is if both blend into something new. The only viable strategy is freedom without sacrificing security (too much).</p>

<h2 id="day-4-4-hours">Day 4 (4 hours)</h2>

<h3 id="section-14-managing-resources">Section 14: Managing Resources</h3>

<p>Without an indication how much CPU and memory a container needs, Kubernetes has no other option than to treat all containers equally. That often produces a very uneven distribution of resource usage. Asking Kubernetes to schedule containers without resource specifications is like entering a taxi driven by a blind person.</p>

<h3 id="section-15-persisting-state">Section 15: Persisting State</h3>

<p>Having fault-tolerance and high-availability is of no use if we lose application state during rescheduling. Having state is unavoidable, and we need to preserve it no matter what happens to our applications, servers, or even a whole datacenter.</p>

<h3 id="section-16-deploying-stateful-applications-at-scale">Section 16: Deploying Stateful Applications At Scale</h3>

<p>Stateless and stateful application are quite different in their architecture. Those differences need to be reflected in Kubernetes as well. The fact that we can use Deployments with PersistentVolumes does not mean that is the best way to run stateful applications.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-up-summary-discussions">Wrap-up: Summary, Discussions</h3>

<p>Interactive Discussion and final Q&amp;A</p>
