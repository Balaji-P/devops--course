<blockquote>
  <p>ConfigMaps allow us to keep configurations separate from application images. Such separation is useful when other alternatives are not a good fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note:
Almost every application can be fine-tuned through configuration. Traditional software deployment methods fostered the use of configuration files. However, we are not discussing traditional, but advanced, distributed, and immutable deployments through Kubernetes schedulers. Usage of fundamentally new technology often requires new processes and different architecture, if we are to leverage its potential to its maximum. On the other hand, we cannot just throw away everything we have and start anew.</p>

<p>We’ll have to try to balance new principles and the legacy needs.</p>

<p>If we were to start developing a new application today, it would be, among other things, distributed, scalable, stateless, and fault tolerant. Those are some of the today’s needs. While we might question how many of us know how to design an application with those quality attributes in mind, hardly anyone would argue against having any of them. What is often forgotten is the configuration. Which mechanism should your new application use to configure itself? How about environment variables?</p>

<p>Environment variables fit well into distributed systems. They are easy to define, and they are portable. They are the ideal choice for configuration mechanism of new applications.</p>

<p>However, in some cases, the configuration might be too complex for environment variables. In such situations, we might need to fall back to files (hopefully YAML). When those cases are combined with legacy applications which are almost exclusively using file-based configuration, it is evident that we cannot rely only on environment variables.</p>

<p>When a configuration is based on files, the best approach we can take is to bake the configuration into a Docker image. That way, we are going down the fully-immutable road. Still, that might not be possible when our application needs different configuration options for various clusters (e.g., testing and production). I’ll ignore my internal need to convert this into a discussion that ends with “you do NOT need a different configuration for different environments”. Rather just assume that you might have an excellent reason for something like that. In such a case, baking config files into images will not do the trick. That’s where ConfigMaps comes into play.</p>

<p>ConfigMap allows us to “inject” configuration into containers. The source of the configs can be files, directories, or literal values. The destination can be files or environment variables.</p>

<p>ConfigMap takes a configuration from a source and mounts it into running containers as a volume.</p>
