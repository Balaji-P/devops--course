<!-- .slide: data-background="img/paragliding.jpg" -->
<blockquote>
  <p>Most applications should be scalable and all must be fault tolerant. Pods do not provide those features, ReplicaSets do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note:
We learned that Pods are the smallest unit in Kubernetes. We also learned that Pods are not fault tolerant. If a Pod is destroyed, Kubernetes will do nothing to remedy the problem. That is, if Pods are created without Controllers.</p>

<p>The first Controller we’ll explore is called <em>ReplicaSet</em>. Its primary, and pretty much only function, is to ensure that a specified number of replicas of a Pod matches the actual state (almost) all the time. That means that ReplicaSets make Pods scalable.</p>

<p>We can think of ReplicaSets as a self-healing mechanism. As long as elementary conditions are met (e.g., enough memory and CPU), Pods associated with a ReplicaSet are guaranteed to run. They provide fault-tolerance and high availability.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning ReplicaSet is the next-generation ReplicationController. The only significant difference is that ReplicaSet has extended support for selectors. Everything else is the same. ReplicationController is considered deprecated, so we’ll focus only on ReplicaSet.</p>
