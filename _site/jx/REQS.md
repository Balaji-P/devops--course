# Requirements

## General

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* GitBash (if using Windows)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* GitHub account

You can choose to have a cluster in Google (GKE), Amazon (EKS), or Azure (AKS). Please follow the instructions for the cloud-specific requirements. If you're in doubt which one to choose, I strongly recommend GKE. If you register, you'll get 300$ in free credit and we won't spend more than a few $ during the workshop.

## GKE (GCP)

Please make sure that you have the tools that follow installed.

* [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts)

You'll need **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) admin permissions**. If you don't have the account or the one you're using does not have admin permissions, please create a personal account by visiting [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/). You'll get $300 of free credit.

Please make sure you have the name of a GCP project ready. If you don't have one, you can follow the instructions from the [Creating and Managing Projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) documentation.

To be on the safe side and confirm that you can create a GKE cluster, please execute the commands that follow.

```bash
gcloud auth login

gcloud container clusters \
    create jxrocks \
    --region us-east1 \
    --machine-type n1-standard-1 \
    --enable-autoscaling \
    --num-nodes 1 \
    --max-nodes 3 \
    --min-nodes 1

kubectl create clusterrolebinding \
    cluster-admin-binding \
    --clusterrole cluster-admin \
    --user $(gcloud config get-value account)

gcloud container clusters \
    delete jxrocks \
    --region us-east1 \
    --quiet
```

Those commands created a GKE cluster and destroyed it right away. Their purpose was only to validate whether you are able to create a GKE cluster. We'll create a new cluster during the training.

Please contact me on [DevOps20](http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/) Slack channel (my user is *vfarcic*) if you encountered any problems.

## EKS (AWS)

Please make sure that you have the tools that follow installed.

* [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
* [eksctl](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl)

You'll need **Amazon Web Services (AWS) admin permissions**. If you don't have the account or the one you're using does not have admin permissions, please create a personal account by visiting [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/account/).

Please make sure you have the name of a GCP project ready. If you don't have one, you can follow the instructions from the [Creating and Managing Projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) documentation.

To be on the safe side and confirm that you can create an EKS cluster, please execute the commands that follow.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[...] # Replace [...] with AWS access key ID

export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[...] # Replace [...] with AWS secret access key

export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2

eksctl create cluster \
    -n jx-rocks \
    -r $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION \
    --kubeconfig kubecfg-eks \
    --node-type t2.small \
    --nodes 3 \
    --nodes-max 9 \
    --nodes-min 3

eksctl delete cluster -n jx-rocks
```

Those commands created an EKS cluster and destroyed it right away. Their purpose was only to validate whether you are able to create an EKS cluster. We'll create a new cluster during the training.

## AKS (Azure)

Please make sure that you have the tools that follow installed.

* [az CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

You'll need **Azure admin permissions**. If you don't have the account or the one you're using does not have admin permissions, please create a personal account by visiting [azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). You'll get $200 of free credit.

To be on the safe side and confirm that you can create an AKS cluster, please execute the commands that follow.

```bash
az login

az provider register -n Microsoft.Network

az provider register -n Microsoft.Storage

az provider register -n Microsoft.Compute

az provider register -n Microsoft.ContainerService

az group create \
    --name jxrocks-group \
    --location eastus

az aks create \
    --resource-group jxrocks-group \
    --name jxrocks-cluster \
    --node-count 3 \
    --node-vm-size Standard_B2s \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --kubernetes-version 1.11.5

az group delete \
    --name jxrocks-group \
    --yes
```

Those commands created an AKS cluster and destroyed it right away. Their purpose was only to validate whether you are able to create an AKS cluster. We'll create a new cluster during the training.
