# Talk: Cloud-Native Kubernetes-First Continuous Delivery With Jenkins X

## Abstract

Jenkins X, an open source project introduced to the community by CloudBees, enables the rapid creation, delivery and orchestration of cloud-native applications based on continuous delivery best practices and the proven Kubernetes platform.

By combining the power of Jenkins, its community and the power of Kubernetes, the Jenkins X project provides a path to the future of continuous delivery for microservices and cloud-native applications.

Jenkins X is Jenkins and additional best of breed tools and software for Kubernetes. It provides an interactive command-line interface to instantiate applications, repositories, environments, and pipelines and orchestrate continuous integration and continuous delivery.

It is the CI/CD solution for development of modern cloud applications on Kubernetes.

We'll explore how to create a fully operational continuous delivery pipeline using Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins X, and quite a few other tools.
