<p>Jenkins X quickly became the standard of how we do continuous delivery in Kubernetes, and much more. It combines the best and the most commonly used open source projects like Tekton and Prow. It ties them together to form a solution that can be used by everyone, no matter the level of their knowledge of the Kubernetes ecosystem.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, many are still confused about why we created Jenkins X in the first place, what it is, and how are companies using it. We’ll answer those questions by looking back at history, explore the present, and try to figure out what the future holds.</p>

<p>We’ll discuss the deficiencies of the “traditional” Jenkins, take a more in-depth look at what Jenkins X is and what were the guiding principles baked into its design. Finally, we’ll explore how are other companies using it, no matter whether they are small startups or big enterprises.</p>
