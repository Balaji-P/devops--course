<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>A lot changed since we were introduced to cloud, Kubernetes, and containers. Whatever we did in the past might not be valid anymore. Our applications need to become cloud-native, we need to adopt Kubernetes as the first class citizen, and there is no doubt anymore that continuous delivery is a must for any company that wants to stay competitive. The problem is that Kubernetes is complicated and the ecosystem is vast. Understanding low-level details takes more time than we might have, and yet we need to get everyone on board. We need a tool that will allow us to leverage all the latest and greatest processes and tools. At the same time, we need them to be simple and straightforward so that everyone can benefit from them. That is the primary objective behind the Jenkins X project. It brings power by combining best practices and tools while keeping it so simple that anyone can use it.</p>

<p>Jenkins X, an open source project introduced to the community by CloudBees, enables the rapid creation, delivery and orchestration of cloud-native applications based on continuous delivery best practices and the proven Kubernetes platform.</p>

<p>By combining the power of Jenkins, its community and the power of Kubernetes, the Jenkins X project provides a path to the future of continuous delivery for microservices and cloud-native applications.</p>

<p>Jenkins X is Jenkins and additional best of breed tools and software for Kubernetes. It provides an interactive command-line interface to instantiate applications, repositories, environments, and pipelines and orchestrate continuous integration and continuous delivery.</p>

<p>It is the CI/CD solution for development of modern cloud applications on Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll explore how to create a fully operational continuous delivery pipeline using containers, Kubernetes, Jenkins X, and quite a few other tools.</p>
