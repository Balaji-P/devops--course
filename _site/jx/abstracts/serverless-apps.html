<p>As serverless computing is gaining momentum, we have to make some hard choices and answer some fundamental questions. What is serverless, and why do we want it? Are cloud vendors like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft the only places where it makes sense to run serverless applications? Which types of applications are good candidates to become serverless? Should we use Kubernetes as the platform to run serverless deployments? How do we manage the lifecycle of our serverless applications?</p>

<p>This talk with try to answer those and quite a few other questions and present Knative as one (out of many) possible platforms we can use to run serverless applications. Weâ€™ll also see a live demonstration of the Knative project and use Jenkins X to manage the lifecycle of our serverless applications.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Knative might become a standard for serverless deployments</li>
  <li>Tekton is likely to become a standard for CI/CD type of serverless loads</li>
</ul>
