<p>What does it take to implement continuous delivery today? What is the recipe?</p>

<p>For years, all we needed was Jenkins and a few agents. Is that still the case? Can we keep up with technology and do continuous delivery as we did it during the last few years?</p>

<p>I bet that if I list all the ingredients, it will turn out that you haven’t even heard about many of them. Kubernetes? That’s an easy one. How about Helm, tekton, skaffold, ChartMuseum, KSync, kaniko, and Prow? What do you get when you mix those and quite a few others and sprinkle them with some GitOps and ChatOps? Is the result something that everyone can use, even if they never heard about those tools?</p>
