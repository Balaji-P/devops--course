3. In the same way that we have the threat modeling environment, how do we move this to our arch environment? Key questions for our stakeholders. How to choose quality attributes that matter, how to prioritize them.

4. When to change the said style? How often does that happen? Minimizing risk by isolating?

5. Each part of the system with a different arch style? How to mix them?

6. Who should be in charge of choosing this?

7. How to get the "experience" designing past systems; or how to share this experience with the team, giving the team autonomy to take decisions on their own? How much autonomy & responsibility should we delegate to the team in terms of these aspects? And by which process should the team and the architect take decisions? Just consensus, just pure logical reasoning, or both (iteratively)? When the debates are going to be too much subjective, should we stop them/mediate?
