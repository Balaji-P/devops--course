# Why Should You Come To DevOps World?

A short while ago a friend asked me a question. "Why should I come to [DevOps World](https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/san-francisco)?" I thought that my answer might be useful to others, so here it goes.

> Before we proceed, please note that what follows are my personal thoughts. You'll hear my reasons and my preferences that are likely very different than what others think.

First of all, DevOps World will be awesome simply because I will be there. Now, I doubt you heard a more egoistic claim than that. If that's what you think, you should also know that egocentric people do not care what you think of them. Or, maybe they do. I'm not sure, and that probably means that I'm not one of them.

With that being said, let's get back to me.

I'll make a personal record for the longest speaking time in any conference. My total speaking time, including both workshops and talks, will be sixteen hours and forty-five minutes, not including sessions with customer and prospects and the time I will be around [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) booth. Now, I can imagine that information by itself is not very appealing and would not convince many. What matters is that I promise that I will have fun in those workshops and the talk. What the audience will get out of them is of secondary importance.

Now, let's assume that my divine presence is not enough to persuade you to come. What else will be happening there that might justify the expense and the journey to San Francisco?

I could tell you that there will be great workshops on Monday and Tuesday (August 12 and 13) but that is irrelevant, simply because you should come to [Continuous Delivery with Jenkins X](https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2019.sched.com/event/S6hG/400-continuous-delivery-with-jenkins-x) hosted by Oscar Medina and I. Given that it is a full-day workshop, you won't have time for others that day, so they are irrelevant. If you do choose a different one, I will take it as a personal offense. I will find you and publicly shame you for making terrible choices.

Now, given that the [Continuous Delivery with Jenkins X](https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2019.sched.com/event/S6hG/400-continuous-delivery-with-jenkins-x) training is repeated both on Monday and Tuesday, you need to choose which day to attend. Take my training on Monday so that you can hear [Introduction to Tekton Pipelines](https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2019.sched.com/event/SQhc/introduction-to-tekton-pipelines) by Vic Iglesias from Google on Tuesday. Why those two workshops? The one about Jenkins X is important because it is about the next generation of continuous delivery tools. It is the replacement of Jenkins or any other similar tool and, as a side note, there is no Jenkins in it. The only similarity between Jenkins and Jenkins X is in the name. It is written from scratch to leverage all the things we feel are essential today. It is cloud-native, Kubernetes-first, fast, scalable, fault-tolerant, etc. It is the future, and it is built on top of Tekton. Even though Jenkins X makes Tekton usage "transparent" and you do not even need to know that it's there, it will be useful to attend Vic's session and get a glimpse of what's happening behind the scenes, no matter whether you will use Tekton directly or through Jenkins X.

Now, let's move to the talks.

The keynote on Tuesday afternoon is bound to be amazing. I am a techie myself and seeing Tara Hernandez (Google), Kohsuke Kawaguchi (creator of Jenkins), Tracy Miranda (Open Source Community), Chris Aniszczyk (The Linux Foundation), James Strachan (creator of Jenkins X), and Andy Glover (Netflix) in one place is mesmerizing. I'll have a powerful and probably uncontrollable desire to lock them in a room and tell them that they will be able to go out only after they start a new open source project. I don't know what that would be, but it would certainly be something amazing.

That keynote will close the day (Tuesday) and what comes after that is for you to make a difficult choice which party to go. It'll be difficult since we're bound to have too many options.

If you did party on Tuesday night, you will be excused if you miss the opening keynotes on Wednesday. It's by a bunch of guys that have CEO or VP in front of their titles. I'm not saying that they don't have exciting things to present (they do), but that my brain is wired to more technical talks. Hence, I highly recommend Jessica Deen's session [From Zero to DevOps Superhero: The Container Edition](https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2019.sched.com/event/S6e7/from-zero-to-devops-superhero-the-container-edition#). She is fantastic, and I'm always looking forward to her talks.

...

I just noticed how boring it must be to start listing the [speakers](https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2019.sched.com/directory/speakers) I'll want to hear, so I'll skip the rest, and only mention that "James" is the keyword. I'm not sure what makes people with that name awesome, but that's how it is. James Strachan, James Rawlings, and James Governor are having talks, and those are bound to be great. As for the rest, make your own choices which [sessions](https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2019.sched.com/) to attend. There's a lot to choose.

That's it. That's all I have to say. Come and let's have some fun.
