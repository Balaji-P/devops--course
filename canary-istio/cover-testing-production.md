Note:
Let's talk about testing in production.

No matter how much we try, the only real validation of a release is how it behaves when running in production. We all know that. But, where we might disagree is which types of validations are needed. Should we run the same tests in production as those we're running in staging? Are we talking about the same technology but potentially different test scenarios? Or is it something completely different?
